# ToDo App

This task aims to evaluate your **component design skills** and ability to appropriately separate **View**, **State**, and **Logic**.

## Task Overview

Develop a simple ToDo list application.  
**Required technologies**: **Next.js** or **React.js**.  
The application should meet the following requirements:

- **You are allowed to use ChatGPT or similar tools.**
- **You may use headless component libraries such as shadcn.**
- **Appropriate use of external packages is encouraged.**
- Feel free to reference design resources such as **Pinterest** or **Mobbin**.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Features

- **Add ToDo items**
- **Delete ToDo items**
- **Update ToDo status**
  - Toggle between "Incomplete" and "Complete."

### 2. Display

- **Categorization of ToDo items**
  - Separate incomplete ToDo items and completed ToDo items into different sections.
- **UI Requirements**
  - The interface should be simple and intuitive to use.

### 3. State Management

- Properly manage the state of each ToDo item (Incomplete/Complete).
- Ensure the state management is simple yet scalable.

### 4. Component Design

- Design reusable components.

### 5. Additional Features

- **Set Deadlines**
  - Allow users to assign deadlines to each ToDo item.
- **Highlight Approaching Deadlines**
  - Visually emphasize items with deadlines within 1 day (e.g., display them in red).
- **Appropriate validation**
  - Establish a range of possible input, such as title, description, etc., and indicate appropriate errors if they are violated.

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**
   - Submit a **GitHub repository link**.
     Alternatively, submit the source code as a ZIP file via email.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Component Design

- Each component has clearly defined responsibilities.
- Reusable components are effectively designed.

### 2. Separation of View, State, and Logic

- Business logic and data operations are appropriately separated from the View (rendering).
- State management is simple and effectively implemented.

### 3. Code Quality

- The code is readable and maintainable.
- Proper comments and naming conventions are followed.

### 4. UI/UX

- The application is intuitive to use.
- The design is visually clear and easy to understand.
